# The King James Bible
Source for https://kingjames.bible, one of many copies of the King James Bible on the web.

This is a labor of love with the end goal being a clean, high quality implementation without distracting fluff.

## Roadmap
Here is the current thinking and relative order of planned features:
* Single Page App (SPA) but retaining SEO features
* Full text searching
* Built-in dictionary
* Copy + Paste functionality to aid in copying bible content to blogs and web sites with configurable styling
* Embeddable "verse of the day"
* Embeddable Bible search
* A flash card style memorization site

Please add feature suggestions to the issue tracker and I'll see what I can do.
