## What Does the Word of God Say About Itself?

[Psalm 119:89](https://kingjames.bible/Psalms-119#89) For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled 
in heaven.

[Psalm 12:6-7](https://kingjames.bible/Psalms-12#6) The words of the LORD _are_ pure words: _as_ silver
tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve
them from this generation for ever.

[Isaiah 40:8](https://kingjames.bible/Isaiah-40#8) The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the
word of our God shall stand for ever.

[Matthew 5:17-18](https://kingjames.bible/Matthew-5#17) Think not that I am come to destroy the
law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till
heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
fulfilled.

[Hebrews 4:12](https://kingjames.bible/Hebrews-4#12) For the word of God _is_ quick, and powerful,
and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and
of the joints and marrow, and _is_ a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

[2 Peter 1:19-21](https://kingjames.bible/II-Peter-1#19) We have also a more sure word of prophecy;
whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture 
is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
holy men of God spake _as they were_ moved by the Holy Ghost.

[John 1:1-5](https://kingjames.bible/John-1#1) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the
light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

[John 1:14](https://kingjames.bible/John-1#14) And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
(and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
truth.

[1 Peter 1:25](https://kingjames.bible/I-Peter-1#25)  But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

[Proverbs 30:5-6](https://kingjames.bible/Proverbs-30#5) Every word of God _is_ pure: he _is_ a
shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee,
and thou be found a liar.

[Psalm 19:7-11](https://kingjames.bible/Psalms-19#7) The law of the LORD _is_ perfect, converting
the soul: the testimony of the LORD _is_ sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD _are_
right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD _is_ pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of
the LORD _is_ clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD _are_ true _and_ righteous altogether.
More to be desired _are they_ than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the
honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: _and_ in keeping of them _there is_ great reward.

[John 17:17](https://kingjames.bible/John-17#17) Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
truth.

## How Shall We Use the Word of God?

[2 Timothy 3:16-17](https://kingjames.bible/II-Timothy-3#16) All scripture _is_ given by inspiration
of God, and _is_ profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

[Revelation 22:18-19](https://kingjames.bible/Revelation-22#18) For I testify unto every man that
heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall
add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words
of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the
holy city, and _from_ the things which are written in this book.

[Deuteronomy 4:2](https://kingjames.bible/Deuteronomy-4#2) Ye shall not add unto the word which I
command you, neither shall ye diminish _ought_ from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD
your God which I command you.

[Romans 15:4](https://kingjames.bible/Romans-15#4) For whatsoever things were written aforetime were
written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

[1 Thessalonians 2:13](https://kingjames.bible/I-Thessalonians-2#13) For this cause also thank we
God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received _it_
not _as_ the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in
you that believe.

[John 5:39](https://kingjames.bible/John-5#39) Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have
eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

[Deuteronomy 12:32](https://kingjames.bible/Deuteronomy-12#32) What thing soever I command you,
observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

[Luke 8:11-15](https://kingjames.bible/Luke-8#11) Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of
God. Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out
of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock _are they,_ which, when they
hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of
temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go
forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of _this_ life, and bring no fruit to
perfection. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, keep _it,_ and bring forth fruit with patience.

[Matthew 4:3-4](https://kingjames.bible/Matthew-4#3) And when the tempter came to him, he said, If
thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is
written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God.

[Psalm 119:11](https://kingjames.bible/Psalms-119#11) Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I 
might not sin against thee.

[Joshua 1:8](https://kingjames.bible/Joshua-1#8) This book of the law shall not depart out of thy
mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to
all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
good success.
