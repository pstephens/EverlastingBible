:desc TODO: Use the Word of God

# How Shall We Use the Word of God?

[2 Timothy 3:16-17](II-Timothy-3#16) All scripture _is_ given by inspiration of God, and _is_ profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

[Revelation 22:18-19](Revelation-22#18) For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and _from_ the things which are written in this book.

[Deuteronomy 4:2](Deuteronomy-4#2) Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish _ought_ from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

[Romans 15:4](Romans-15#4) For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

[1 Thessalonians 2:13](I-Thessalonians-2#13) For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received _it_ not _as_ the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

[John 5:39](John-5#39) Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

[Deuteronomy 12:32](Deuteronomy-12#32) What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

[Luke 8:11-15](Luke-8#11) Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. They on the rock _are they,_ which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of _this_ life, and bring no fruit to perfection. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep _it,_ and bring forth fruit with patience.

[Matthew 4:3-4](Matthew-4#3) And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

[Psalm 119:11](Psalms-119#11) Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.

[Joshua 1:8](Joshua-1#8) This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

[2 Timothy 2:15](II-Timothy-2#15) Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
