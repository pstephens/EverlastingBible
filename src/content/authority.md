# What Does the Word of God Say About Itself?

[Psalm 119:89](Psalms-119#89) For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

[Psalm 12:6-7](Psalms-12#6) The words of the LORD _are_ pure words: _as_ silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

[Isaiah 40:8](Isaiah-40#8) The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

[Matthew 5:17-18](Matthew-5#17) Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

[Hebrews 4:12](Hebrews-4#12) For the word of God _is_ quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and _is_ a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

[2 Peter 1:19-21](II-Peter-1#19) We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake _as they were_ moved by the Holy Ghost.

[John 1:1-5](John-1#1) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

[John 1:14](John-1#14) And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

[1 Peter 1:25](I-Peter-1#25)  But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

[Proverbs 30:5-6](Proverbs-30#5) Every word of God _is_ pure: he _is_ a shield unto them that put their trust in him. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

[Psalm 19:7-11](Psalms-19#7) The law of the LORD _is_ perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD _is_ sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the LORD _are_ right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD _is_ pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the LORD _is_ clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD _are_ true _and_ righteous altogether. More to be desired _are they_ than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: _and_ in keeping of them _there is_ great reward.

[John 17:17](John-17#17) Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
